# Credits

This project was developed independently as a Linux automation tool for
CyberPatriot training and competition use.

## Inspiration

The concept and general automation approach were inspired by the following
Windows-based project:

- **Project Name:** CyberPatriotAutomation
- **Language / Platform:** C# (Windows automation)
- **Author:** Maxwell McCormick
- **Repository:** https://github.com/NotMaxwell/CyberPatriotAutomation


No source code, scripts, or assets from the above project were used.
All logic, structure, and implementation in this repository were written
independently for Linux systems.
